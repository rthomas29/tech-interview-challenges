## Tech Interview Challenges

Whether you agree that whiteboard interview questions are an efficient way of testing a programmer's skills or not, they're an integral part of most  interview processes. With that said, I'm creating this repo to showcase my solutions to the questions I'm asked in interviews.

I've been asked questions in an interview that I **know** for sure, but I blank. It happens. We're not perfect! However, I'm hoping this repo will give me an opportunity to redeem myself and solidify those concepts. Every opportunity is an opportunity to learn if you're open to it. ðŸ˜Š
